Student Grades
The goal of this exercise is to help the students to know their average, by entering the grade of each subject to our page web.

Remark: the number of subjects should be dynamic, it means that the student enters the number of his subjects before he enters their grade.

To apply this, we need to create a bootstrap form to capture the necessary data and then we want to save this information to calculate the average of each student.

The page should contain a button “Show Result” that displays in a section (table for example) the name of the student, the grade for each subject, the total of his grades, his average, and a message according to his average.

Remark: you want to use the bootstrap danger alert, warning alert, primary alert, and success alert to display the message.

If the average is between 0 and 49 the message will be “Unfortunately you failed!”.

If the average is between 50 and 60 the message will be “Congratulations, you passed but you have to work better”.

If the average is between 60 and 80 the message will be “Congratulations, you succeeded”.

If the average is between 80 and 100 the message will be “Congratulations, you’ve achieved an excellent score!”.

When the user reloads the page, he can enter the grades of another student to calculate his average. But all information about the former(previous) student will disappear for now.
